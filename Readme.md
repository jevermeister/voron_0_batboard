# Batboard

The batboard is a passive tool board mounting on the back of the MiniAB pancake 
stepper of the Voron 0.1. The board solidly mounts with 20mm brass standoffs to the 
back of the mini after burner mounting screws and provides JST PH connectors 
(2mm pitch) for the two part cooling fans, the hotend fan, a 4-pin thermistor, 
two switches (for example the X endstop + a klicky probe) as well as the stepper and a chamber thermistor. 
The heater output is provided as a 2x1 Molex Microfit connector and all terminals 
are terminated onto a 2x9 Microfit.
